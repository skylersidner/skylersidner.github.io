1/30/2015 Day 5 - Moar Rock/Paper/Scissors
---

* Something I could teach:  I think I could (with some clarity) explain the relationship and definitions of concepts like Classes, Methods, Instantiation, Objects, Attributes, and Parameters.  This was a really big "A-ha!" moment for me on Wednesday, and it has enabled me to start coding a bit more deeply, where I am starting to learn about scope.

* Something other class members understand better than me: How to call (and more specifically iterate over) hashes and arrays.  I understand what they are and the subtle differences (I think) but still struggle when it comes time to implement more complex logic relationships between them.

* Non-coding highlights from this week:  Learning to use a little yoga and relaxing breathing before bed to help me sleep; Learning--bit by bit--about my peers and starting to create social relationships with everyone; finding my comfort zone in life balancing socializing, errands, class, homework, etc.
