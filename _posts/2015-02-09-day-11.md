Wanted to make a video, ran out of time.  Perhaps tomorrow?

1. What is "Software Development?"

As I understand it, software development is creating tools to manipulate data; generally, this assumes code writing.  Building things like programs, APIs, database, web-pages, and a host of other technologies that do different things to data.  It seems like it is becomming a broader spectrum every day, as IT grows and technology works its way deeper into our lives.  Building an app for a smart-phone is absolutely software development, yet that didn't exist 20 years ago when developing programs for computers did.

2. Why was working in a pair valuable?

I learned a tremendous amount about myself, and suddenly saw many things about how I code in new ways as I was forced to apply them at a different pace and in a different way.  It was extremely challenging to give up my independence, and it's not something I'm eager to do again.  I like a little isolation.  I like being told what to do.  It is remarkable how much can be gained re: the self from being placed next to another.
