Today, I learned a fair amount of navigation for command line:
  Command+K => Clear screen
  cd      => Change Directory
  pwd     => Print Working Directory (Show me where I am.)
  ls      => List Short (Show me everything in this directory.)
  cd ..   => Go up (back) 1 tier; can be stacked
  cd ../  => /(folder name here) Go up 1 tier, down into folder name, etc.
  Tab     => Auto-complete commands, file-names, etc.
  mate    => Can open files folders
  touch   => Create file (or re-date) by name
  mk dir  => Create directory (folder)
  ruby    => Runs file name in Ruby
  pry     => Run Ruby environment in Terminal
  rm (-rf)=> Remove files, directories (with flags)
  
I also learned several Git commands:
  git init    => Initializes a working directory into a git repository (notice the prompt change)
  git status  => Displays differences in the directory from the repository
  git add     => Moves files, directories to staging (by name); can be stacked
  git commit  => Commit stage to timeline, and create a message file
  git log     => Shows timeline, reverse chronology; Q to exit
  git checkout=> Rollback changes to any files to pverious commit; CAREFUL

Lastly, I defined Methods, Objects, and Classes.
Methods are a set of operations to be performed on an object
Objects are somthing with attributes and behaviors (operations)
Classes define behaviors and attributes for an object.

Learned so much!
