Main concepts in building good code:

  - Single Responsibility Principle
  The idea that each method should only have a single goal to perform.  You can draft methods to work for you, and this creates a more modular code structure, prevents problems of breaking variables and other methods.
  
  - Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
  If something is done more than once somewhere, it should probably be a method and called when necessary.
  
  - Method/Variable Naming
  Using conventions that are easily interpreted and very readable.  Descriptive over concise.  What does your method/variable do?  Be specific unless it is locally obvious.
  
  - Indentation
  Using correct indentation structure to not only increase readability but track flow of methods, loops, conditions, etc.
  
  - Formatting
  Making sure that your code has proper syntax and convention.  i.e.: class names are all first-letter uppercase; using underscore ( _ ) between words, etc.
  
  
Personal note: first day of yoga!  Was wonderful relaxtion, will probably attempt to make it to sessions as often as possible.  Might sleep better tonight, and I'm consdering doing some meditation/stretching before bed.
